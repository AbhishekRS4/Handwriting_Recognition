The alexnet architecture was created based on http://dangminhthang.com/computer-vision/character-recognition-using-alexnet/ and the alexnet original paper https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf

The model is located in "load_alexnet.py"
Habbakuk dataset is used for pretraining and it is located at "habbakuk_train.py"
The training and testing is located at "train.py"
To train the alexnet run the file "main.py"
